# Character Name Generator

## Introduction

The Character Name Generator is a web-based tool designed to generate random character names. It features a video game-inspired theme, interactive elements, and sound effects to provide an engaging user experience. The names generated are suitable for fantasy and medieval settings, making this tool ideal for creative projects such as games and stories.

## Features

- **Random Name Generation**: Generates a random first name and last name from a predefined list.
- **Interactive UI**: Includes hover effects, animations, and a dynamic name display to enhance user interaction.
- **Sound Effects**: Plays sound effects when generating a new name or clicking the button, adding an auditory element to the experience.
- **Video Game Aesthetic**: Utilizes retro gaming fonts and a vibrant color scheme for an appealing design.
- **Background Animation**: Features a subtle moving background pattern that adds depth and interest to the user interface.

## How It Was Made

### HTML

The HTML file provides the basic structure of the web page. It includes a heading, a container for displaying the generated name, a button to trigger name generation, and audio elements for the sound effects.

### CSS

The CSS file styles the web page to give it a video game-inspired look and feel. This includes importing a retro gaming font, applying a color scheme, and adding animations and transitions. The background features a subtle moving pattern to add depth to the design.

### JavaScript

The JavaScript file contains the logic for generating random names, playing sound effects, and animating the name display. It defines two arrays, one for first names and one for last names, and selects random elements from these arrays to create a full name. The script also handles playing sound effects when the user interacts with the button and animating the name display for a dynamic experience.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. **Open the HTML File**: Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. **Generate Names**: Click the "Generate Name" button to generate random character names.

## Future Enhancements

- **Name Customization**: Allow users to input their own lists of first and last names.
- **Save and Share**: Enable users to save and share generated names.
- **Additional Themes**: Provide different themes for various settings (e.g., sci-fi, modern).
